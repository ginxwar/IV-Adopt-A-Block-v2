This page, for now, mixes the Admin view and a Volunteer view, for testing reasons.
Right now there is menu on the left panel with:

- Real Time 
    should show where volunteers are. (TO DO)

- Editor
    allows to define blocks drawing them on the map. Putting markers instead I simulate the volunteers movement
  
- PacMan
    add the pacmanized streets. It's a MapTile I created with TileMill, importing Isla Vista streets from OpenStreets.
    note: the MapTile has been created with the help of this guide: https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/
