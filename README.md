### IV Adopt-A-Block v2 ###

IV Adopt-a-Block is an application and platform in which mobile users are tracked along a route in Isla Vista during trash cleanup events.  Mobile users can additionally take pictures of hazardous pictures along the way to alert an administrator of a hazardous event.  All of the information is POSTed to a REST layer and is tracked in a Mongo database.  The administrative web page assists the administrator in aggregating statistics, view/verify routes and current volunteers’ position,  user searchable details, and other summary pages.
